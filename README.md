Automated Control System Engineer, Software Engineer (C++, SCADA, PLC, HMI)

Work experience: 2 years and 7 months, mainly as an automated control system programmer

He has developed projects based on Simens and ARIES, namely:

- a system of monjuses, the role of which is to dose bulk materials (sand, crushed stone, etc.) due to electric drives mounted on valves (they are controlled by CAMOZZI pneumatic valves) and a sensor that monitors injection and then displacement, followed by discharge into the main line due to the generated pressure and subsequent injection of the same pressure. PLCs were used by Simens (Simatic 7Step software in the LD FBD language), the ARM was written and visualized on Windows, unfortunately not by me, but I made adjustments anyway, as the system was simplified (ACCORDING to WinCC);

- automation of water and steam blowing devices for boilers. I coordinated PTK, switches, contactors, network equipment, temperature and pressure sensors with the customer (I have experience working with the customer), mainly used PLC and HMI panels from ARIES, but also worked with Weintek and Elara. After the configuration was approved, he developed programs, connection diagrams, selected emergency equipment, contactors, chokes, relays, etc. I assembled control cabinets for the pumping station and the devices themselves. And at the end, the commissioning is in place.

- a CNC bending machine from Eurobend, commissioning after the acquisition, I had to assign a movement and positioning system for the encoder, servos in C++, since the hard disk with the software simply burned out, and it was not registered on the backup copy.

In the process of deep learning C++.
Has experience in AI-based programming.
In the future, I want to connect my life with programming, and I will strive for this.

If you are a company that is interested in young and motivated specialists, and you value the time and work of your people, I think we will work together.
